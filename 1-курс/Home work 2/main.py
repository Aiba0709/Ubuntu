# text = '''Advertising hoardings in the street make our environment colourful. 
# And adverts on TV are often funny.
# Sometimes they are mini-dramas and we wait for the next programme in the mini-drama.
# Advertising can educate, too. Adverts tell us about new, healthy products.
# And adverts in magazines give us ideas for how to look prettier,
# be fashionable and be successful. Without advertising, life is boring and colourless.
# But some consumers argue that advertising is a bad thing.
# They say that advertising is bad for children.
# Adverts make children pester their parents buy things for them.
# Advertisers know we love our children and want to give them everything.
# So they use childrens pester power to sell their products. Finally, consumers say,
# if there is advertising there must be rules.
# Some adverts advertise unhealthy things like cigarettes and make people waste their money.'''
